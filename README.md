# Projects tracker
Why this project? I wanted something to track my projects that also others could access at the same time, as Excel or MS Project were buggy and VBA was not beautiful (bear in mind that I am not a software engineer and Click or the other stuff could not be used)...and here you go, the version 0 of a project tracker.

There is still a lot to add, improve, and learn here.
